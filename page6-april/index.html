        April 7th.

        That’s when I finally said what I had been holding in for a long time.
        I spoke honestly, without expectations — just truth.

        She didn’t feel the same.

        It wasn’t cruel. It wasn’t loud.
        But it was enough to change something inside me.

        I stayed quiet after that.
        Not because I was angry —
        but because I was learning how to carry disappointment
        without turning it into bitterness.
      </P>
